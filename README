CURRENTLY SUPPORTED IMPORT FORMATS
Wordpress XML


WHAT'S NEW

Mar 3/2013
- FIXED: Clean up importing of text -- no longer one big block of text -- wordpress exports using unix control codes that aren't handled in XML/importing the post as nice as they automatically should.  Converter now detects \n and replaces with <br/> to maintain post readbility.
- FEATURE: Implemented initial support to import images from Wordpress to the {siteid}/Assets/Image/ folder.  Captions not supported at this time, you'll have to clean them out by hand for the time being.  Updated admin screen to explain how images are uploaded.

Mar 2/2013
- FIXED: Post status (draft or publish) wasn't being set correctly, it sure is now.

Feb 23/2013

- FEATURE: Added selector to import comments or not
- Merged in devel branch features for importing comments (not tested or made visible yet while testing), this should be enough to merge this out.

Feb 22/2013
